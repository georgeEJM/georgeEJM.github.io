    Supreme/The Killer<br>
    23/10/2018<br><br>
    The Killer is a 1989 action film written and directed by John Woo. Chow Yun-fat plays Ah Jong, a Hong Kong Triad assassin who damages a nightclub singer’s eyes during a shootout. To fund the operation that will save her sight, Ah Jong accepts one final job — where he is discovered by Li Ying, a police detective who becomes obsessed with the hitman’s code of ethics. The Killer is often referred to as a "bullet ballet” — revered for both its intricately choreographed battles and its notions of honor.<br><br>

    This fall, Supreme has worked on a collection featuring imagery from The Killer. The collection consists of an M-65 Jacket, Hooded Sweatshirt, two T-Shirts and a Skateboard.<br><br>

    Available in-store NY, Brooklyn, LA, London, Paris and online October 25th.<br><br>

    Available in Japan on October 27th.
